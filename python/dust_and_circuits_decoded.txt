Dust and Circuits

The robot's wheels carved shallow trails across the endless sand. Its sensors flickered with heat, scanning the dry horizon. Somewhere in this desolate desert, its mission data said, there was an old satellite buried beneath the dunes.

Each morning, it rebooted with the rising sun, its solar panels unfolding like metal wings. At night, it shut down to preserve energy, listening to the wind howl through empty canyons.

Day by day, the sand shifted. The robot pressed forward, undeterred. Though it had no voice and no face, it held a quiet determination in every gear and wire.

And one day, as the sky turned red with dusk, its sensors caught a faint ping - the lost satellite, just beneath its treads.
